## Exercises
### Create a local repo, connect it to a remote repo
1. A uses `git init` to create a new local repo
1. A creates a new remote repo on github
1. A adds the remote repo as a new remote called `origin` in their local repo
1. A adds B as collaborator on the remote repo on Github
1. B clones the workshop onto their machine

### Fork & Clone a Repo
1. A forks workshop on Github
1. A adds the original repo as a new remote called `upstream`
1. A adds B as collaborator on workshop on Github
1. A and B clone workshop onto their machine

### Without branching
_Bad in general, but sufficient for workshops_
1. A makes a commit and pushes it up to github
1. B pulls changes down from github, adds a commit, pushes it to github
1. A pulls changes down from github, adds a commit, pushes it to github
1. Rinse, repeat.

### With branching, but only one fork
_Better than above - good for senior phase projects!_
1. A makes a new branch
1. A makes a commit and pushes it to github
1. B fetches changes from github
1. B checkouts the new branch that A made
1. B adds a commit and pushes it to github
1. A pulls down changes from github, adds a commit, pushes it to github
1. B pulls down changes from github, adds a commit, pushes it to github
1. B makes a Pull Request on github (not the same thing as running git pull!)
1. A approves the request on github
1. A pulls down changes from the remote
1. Rinse, repeat.

### With branching and separate forks

1. B forks workshop on Github
1. B adds the original repo as a new remote called `upstream`
1. B adds A's fork as another remote
